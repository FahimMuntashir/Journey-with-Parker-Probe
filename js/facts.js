            <h2>10 Need-to-Know Things About the Solar System</h2>
            <h3>1. ONE OF BILLIONS</h3>
            <p>Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets,
                asteroids and comets.</p>
            <h3>2. MEET ME IN THE ORION ARM</h3>
            <p>Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We’re in
                one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.</p>
            <h3>3. A LONG WAY ROUND</h3>
            <p>It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</p>
            <h3>4. SPIRALING THROUGH SPACE</h3>
            <p>There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral
                galaxy.</p>
            <h3>5. GOOD ATMOSPHERE(S)</h3>
            <p>Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds - including
                Earth - with many kinds of atmospheres.</p>
            <h3>6. MANY MOONS</h3>
            <p>The planets of our solar system - and even some asteroids - hold more than 150 moons in their orbits.</p>
            <h3>7. RING WORLDS</h3>
            <p>The four giant planets - and at least one asteroid - have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn’s
                gorgeous rings.</p>
            <h3>8. LEAVING THE CRADLE</h3>
            <p>More than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth orbit, including 24 astronauts
                who orbited the moon.</p>
            <h3>9. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT</h3>
            <p>Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re
                looking for more everywhere we can.</p>
            <h3>10. FAR-RANGING ROBOTS</h3>
            <p>NASA’s Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft so far to leave our solar system. Four other spacecraft will
                eventually hit interstellar space.</p>`,

            <h1>Oort Cloud</h1>
            <h2>10 Need-to-Know Things About the Oort Cloud</h2>
            <h3>1. PREDICTED REALM</h3>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is a predicted collection of icy objects farther away than everything else in the solar system. It fits with observations of comets in the planetary region of the solar system, but scientists have yet to observe any object in the Oort Cloud itself.</p>
            <h3>2. FAR, FAR AWAY</h3>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is a spherical layer of icy objects surrounding our Sun, a star, and likely occupies space at a distance between about 2,000 and 100,000 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <h3>3. LONG WAY ROUND</h3>
            <p>Long-period comets (which take more than 200 years to orbit the Sun) probably come from the Oort Cloud, which is sometimes described as a “cometary reservoir."</p>
            <h3>4. BIG NUMBERS</h3>
            <p>Predictions show the Oort Cloud may contain more than a trillion icy objects.</p>
            <h3>5. CLOSER AND BIGGER</h3>
            <p>When comets from the Oort Cloud approach the Sun, their surface ices vaporize, producing a cometary atmosphere (a coma) and often two tails (one dust, one gas) that can reach hundreds or even millions of miles (or kilometers) in length.</p>
            <p>The activity subsides, and the coma collapses, when the comet’s orbit carries it far enough away from the Sun.</p>
            <h3>6. PRIMITIVE</h3>
            <p>Some of the molecules found on comets formed before the Sun was born.</p>
            <p>They could not survive at temperatures and pressures found on or around Earth.</p>
            <p>By studying the conditions under which primitive cometary molecules can form, scientists can better understand what the environment of our solar system was like at its birth, which provides clues about how it formed and evolved.</p>
            <h3>7. EXO-COMETS</h3>
            <p>Astronomers have seen evidence for comets disintegrating around other stars, the same way Comet ISON did when it grazed our Sun in 2013.</p>
            <p>By using spectrometry to study those comets’ chemical composition, scientists can compare the birth of our solar system to those of other planetary systems.</p>
            <p>A planetary system is the collection of planets, asteroids, etc. orbiting a star or stars. Our planetary system orbits the Sun, which is “Sol” in Latin. So we call our planetary system the solar system.</p>
            <h3>8. A LONG TRIP</h3>
            <p>No missions have been sent to explore the Oort Cloud yet, but five spacecraft will eventually get there.</p>
            <p>They are Voyager 1 and 2, New Horizons, and Pioneer 10 and 11.</p>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is so distant, however, that the power sources for all five spacecraft will be dead centuries before they reach its inner edge.</p>
            <h3>9. COLD AND DARK</h3>
            <p>The frozen, comet-like bodies of the Oort Cloud are not capable of supporting life as we know it.</p>
            <h3>10. DEEP THINKER</h3>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is named for Jan Oort, the Dutch astronomer who predicted its existence in the 1950s.</p>`,

            <h2>10 Need-to-Know Things About the Kuiper Belt</h2>
            <h3>1. DISTANT DESTINATION</h3>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt is a region of space. The known icy worlds and comets in both regions are much smaller than Earth's Moon.</p>
            <h3>2. COSMIC DOUGHNUT</h3>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt is a doughnut-shaped ring of icy objects around the Sun, extending just beyond the orbit of Neptune from about 30 to 55 AU.</p>
            <h3>3. LONG TRIP</h3>
            <p>Short-period comets (which take less than 200 years to orbit the Sun) originate in the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <h3>4. BIG COUNT</h3>
            <p>There may be hundreds of thousands of icy bodies larger than 100 km (62 miles) and an estimated trillion or more comets within the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <h3>5. SPACESUIT REQUIRED</h3>
            <p>Some dwarf planets within the Kuiper Belt have thin atmospheres that collapse when their orbit carries them farthest from the Sun.</p>
            <h3>6. TINY MOONS</h3>
            <p>Several dwarf planets within the Kuiper Belt have moons.</p>
            <h3>7. RING WORLD</h3>
            <p>Egg-shaped Haumea has a ring around it.</p>
            <h3>8. FIRST LOOK</h3>
            <p>The first mission to explore the Kuiper Belt is New Horizons. It flew past Pluto in 2015 and is on its way to explore another Kuiper Belt world.</p>
            <h3>9. COLD AND DARK</h3>
            <p>It is not clear if worlds in this distant, cold region are not capable of supporting life as we know it.</p>
            <h3>10. HYPOTHETICAL PLANET X</h3>
            <p>Astronomers are searching for a possible planet that might explain the strange orbits of several Kuiper Belt Objects. The nickname: Planet 9.</p>`,

            <h1>Jupiter - Twice as massive as all the other planets combined</h1>
            <h2>Interesting Facts About Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter’s four largest moons (the Galilean Satellites) are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.</p>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system at nearly 11 times the size of Earth and 317 times its mass.</p>
            <p>Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.</p>
            <p>Despite its size, Jupiter has the shortest day of any other planet; it only takes about 10 hours for a complete rotation.</p>
            <p>A lot like the Sun, Jupiter is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter contains the largest ocean in the solar system, an ocean of liquid hydrogen.</p><br>

            <h2>10 Need-to-Know Things about Jupiter</h2>
            <h3>1.THE GRANDEST PLANET</h3>
            <p>Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter’s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.</p>
            <h3>2. FIFTH PLANET FROM OUR STAR</h3>
            <p>Jupiter orbits about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU) from our Sun (Earth is one AU from the Sun).</p>
            <h3>3. SHORT DAY/LONG YEAR</h3>
            <p>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).</p>
            <h3>4. WHAT’S INSIDE</h3>
            <p>Jupiter is a gas giant and so lacks an Earth-like surface.</p>
            <p>If it has a solid inner core at all, it’s likely only about the size of Earth.</p>
            <h3>5. MASSIVE WORLD, LIGHT ELEMENTS</h3>
            <p>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</p>
            <h3>6. WORLDS GALORE</h3>
            <p>Jupiter has more than 75 moons </p>
            <h3>7. RINGED WORLD</h3>
            <p>In 1979 the Voyager mission discovered Jupiter’s faint ring system.</p>
            <p>All four giant planets in our solar system have ring systems.</p>
            <h3>8. EXPLORING JUPITER</h3>
            <p>Nine spacecraft have visited Jupiter.</p>
            <p>Seven flew by and two have orbited the gas giant. Juno, the most recent, arrived at Jupiter in 2016.</p>
            <h3>9. INGREDIENTS FOR LIFE?</h3>
            <p>Jupiter cannot support life as we know it.</p>
            <p>But some of Jupiter's moons have oceans beneath their crusts that might support life.</p>
            <h3>10. SUPER STORM</h3>
            <p>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that’s about twice the size of Earth and has raged for over a century.</p>`,
