            <h1>Solar System</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
            <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.</p>
            <p>Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in night sky.</p>
            <p>So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time.</p>
            <p>Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.</p>
            <p>While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there.</p>
            <p>It seems that we live in a universe packed with planets — a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects, perhaps some with life of their own.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>Our solar system extends much farther than the eight planets that orbit the Sun.</p>
            <p>The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit.</p>
            <p>This is a sparsely occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object, dwarf planet Pluto.</p>
            <p>And beyond the fringes of the Kuiper belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system.</p>
            <p>It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.</p>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris the sizes of mountains and sometimes larger, orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light years away.</p>
            <p>This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units.</p>
            <p>One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).</p>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.</p>
            <p>The Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far.</p>
            <p>The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind — a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.</p>
            <p>The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock.</p>
            <p>This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.</p>
            <p>Two NASA spacecraft, launched in 1977, have crossed the termination shock: Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers exit the Oort Cloud.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust.</p>
            <p>The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova.</p>
            <p>When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula - a spinning, swirling disk of material.</p>
            <p>At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in.</p>
            <p>Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.</p>
            <p>With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99 percent of the available matter.</p>
            <p>Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together.These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects.</p>
            <p>Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and large moons.</p>
            <p>In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet.</p>
            <p>Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed.</p>
            <p>Nearest the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young.</p>
            <p>For this reason, the first four planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars - are terrestrial planets. They're small with solid, rocky surfaces.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system.</p>
            <p>Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Our solar system is the only place we know of that harbors life, but the farther we explore the more we find potential for life in other places.</p>
            <p>Both Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moon Enceladus have global saltwater oceans under thick, icy shells.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>There are more than 150 known moons in our solar system and several more awaiting confirmation of discovery.</p>
            <p>Of the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons.</p>
            <p>The giant planets grab the most moons. Jupiter and Saturn have long lead our solar system’s moon counts.</p>
            <p>In some ways, the swarms of moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system.</p>
            <p>Pluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including the Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble.</p>
            <p>Even tiny asteroids can have moons. In 2017, scientists found asteroid 3122 Florence had two tiny moons.</p>`,

            <h1>Oort Cloud</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Oort Cloud lies far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>While the planets of our solar system orbit in a flat plane, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the Sun, planets and Kuiper Belt Objects.</p>
            <p>It's like a big, thick bubble around our solar system, made of icy, comet-like objects.</p>
            <p>The Oort Cloud's icy bodies can be as large as mountains — and sometimes larger.</p>
            <h2>Scale and Distance</h2>
            <p>The Oort Cloud is the most distant region in our solar system.</p>
            <p>It's jaw-droppingly far away, extending perhaps one-quarter to halfway from our Sun to the next star.</p>
            <p>To appreciate the distance to the Oort Cloud, it’s helpful to set aside miles and kilometers and instead use the astronomical unit, or AU — a unit defined as the distance between Earth and the Sun, with 1 AU being roughly 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.</p>
            <p>For comparison, Pluto’s more elliptical orbit carries it between about 30 and 50 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <p>The inner edge of the Oort Cloud is thought to be located between 2,000 and 5,000 AU from the Sun, with the outer edge being located somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <p>At its current speed of about a million miles a day, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft won't enter the Oort Cloud for about 300 years. And it won’t exit the outer edge for maybe 30,000 years.</p>
            <p>When light leaves the Sun, it takes a little over eight minutes to reach Earth, and about 4.5 hours to reach Neptune’s orbit. Just under three hours after passing Neptune’s orbit, the Sun’s light passes beyond the outer edge of the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>After another 12 hours the sunlight reaches the heliopause, where the solar wind smooshes up against the interstellar medium.</p>
            <p>Beyond this boundary is interstellar space, where the Sun’s magnetic field holds no sway. The sunlight has now been traveling away from the Sun for about 17 hours.</p>
            <p>Less than one Earth day after leaving the Sun, the sunlight has already traveled farther from the Sun than any human-made spacecraft.</p>
            <p>Yet somehow it will be another 10 to 28 days before that same sunlight reaches the inner edge of the Oort Cloud, and perhaps as much as a year and a half before the sunlight passes beyond the Oort Cloud’s outer edge.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>The leading idea for the formation of the Oort Cloud says that these icy objects were not always so far from the Sun. But the Oort Cloud could also capture objects that didn’t form in the solar system.</p>
            <p>After the planets formed 4.6 billion years ago, the region in which they formed still contained lots of leftover chunks called planetesimals.</p>
            <p>Planetesimals formed from the same material as the planets did. The gravity of the planets then scattered the planetesimals every which way.</p>
            <p>Some planetesimals were ejected from the solar system entirely, while others were flung into eccentric orbits where they were still held by the Sun’s gravity, but were far enough out that galactic influences also tugged on them. Likely the strongest influence was the tidal force from our galaxy itself.</p>
            <p>In short, gravity from the planets shoved many icy planetesimals away from the Sun, and gravity from the galaxy likely caused them to settle in the borderlands of the solar system, where the planets couldn’t perturb them anymore. And they became what we now call the Oort Cloud.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Unlike the planets, the main asteroid belt and many objects in the Kuiper Belt, objects in Oort Cloud do not necessarily travel in the same direction in a shared orbital plane around the Sun.</p>
            <p>Instead, they can travel under, over and at various inclinations, around the Sun as a thick bubble of distant, icy debris. Hence, they’re called the Oort Cloud rather than the Oort Belt.</p>
            <p>Dutch astronomer Jan Oort proposed the existence of the cloud to explain (among other things) where long-period comets come from, and why they seem to come from all directions rather than along the orbital plane shared by the planets, asteroids and the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <h2>Home of Long-Period Comets</h2>
            <p>There may be hundreds of billions, even trillions, of icy bodies in the Oort Cloud.</p>
            <p>Now and then, something disturbs the orbit of one of these icy worlds, and it begins a long fall toward our Sun.</p>
            <p>Two recent examples are comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2013 A1 Siding Spring. ISON disintegrated when it passed too close to the Sun.</p>
            <p>Siding Spring, which made a very close pass by Mars, survived its visit to the inner solar system, but will not return for about 740,000 years.</p>
            <p>Most known long-period comets have been seen only once in recorded history because their orbital periods are so, well, long. (Hence the name.)</p>
            <p>Countless more unknown long-period comets have never been seen by human eyes. Some have orbits so long that the last time they passed through the inner solar system, our species did not yet exist.</p>     
            <p>Others have never ventured close to the Sun in the billions of years since they formed.</p>`,

            <h1>Kuiper Belt</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt is a large region in the cold, outer reaches of our solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune, sometimes called the "third zone" of the solar system.</p>
            <p>Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region - including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide.</p>
            <p>Some, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide.</p>
            <p>In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane. </p>
            <p>The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. </p>
            <p>Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. </p>
            <p>Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs. </p>
            <p>Whatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our planetary system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about the solar system's early history.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt is one of the largest structures in our solar system - others being the Oort Cloud, the heliosphere and the magnetosphere of Jupiter.</p>
            <p>Its overall shape is like a puffed-up disk, or donut.</p>
            <p>Its inner edge begins at the orbit of Neptune, at about 30 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <p>The inner, main region of the Kuiper belt ends to around 50 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Overlapping the outer edge of the main part of the Kuiper Belt is a second region called the scattered disk, which continues outward to nearly 1,000 AU, with some bodies on orbits that go even further beyond.</p>
            <p>So far, over 2,000 trans-Neptunian objects have been cataloged by observers, representing only a tiny fraction of the total number of objects scientists think are out there.</p>
            <p>In fact, astronomers estimate there are hundreds of thousands of objects in the region that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide or larger.</p>
            <p>However, the total mass of all the material in the Kuiper Belt is estimated to be no more than about 10 percent of the mass of Earth.</p>
            <h2>Formation & Origins</h2>
            <p>Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system.</p>
            <p>Similar to the relationship between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter, it's a region of objects that might have come together to form a planet had Neptune not been there.</p>
            <p>Instead, Neptune's gravity stirred up this region of space so much that the small, icy objects there weren't able to coalesce into a large planet.</p>
            <p>The amount of material in the Kuiper Belt today might be just a small fraction of what was originally there.</p>
            <p>According to one well-supported theory, the shifting orbits of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) could have caused most of the original material - likely 7 to 10 times the mass of Earth - to be lost.</p>
            <p>The basic idea is that early in the solar system's history, Uranus and Neptune were forced to orbit farther from the Sun due shifts in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
            <p>As they drifted farther outward, they passed through the dense disk of small, icy bodies left over after the giant planets formed.</p>
            <p>Neptune's orbit was the farthest out, and its gravity bent the paths of countless icy bodies inward toward the other giants.</p>
            <p>Jupiter ultimately slingshotted most of these icy bodies either into extremely distant orbits (to form the Oort Cloud) or out of the solar system entirely.</p>
            <p>As Neptune tossed icy objects sunward, this caused its own orbit to drift even farther out, and its gravitational influence forced remaining icy objects into the range of locations where we find them in the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>Today the Kuiper Belt is slowly eroding itself away.</p>
            <p>Objects that remain there occasionally collide, producing smaller objects fragmented by the collision, sometimes comets and also dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind.</p>
            <h2>Structure & Characteristics</h2>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt represents an enormous, donut-shaped volume of space in the outer solar system.</p>
            <p>While there are many icy bodies in this region that we broadly refer to as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), they're fairly diverse in size, shape and color.</p>
            <p>And importantly, they're not evenly distributed through space - once astronomers started discovering them in the early 1990s, one of the early surprises was that KBOs could be grouped according to the shapes and sizes of their orbits.</p>
            <p>This led scientists to understand that there are several distinct groupings, or populations, of these objects whose orbits provide clues about their history.</p>
            <p>Which category an object belongs to has a lot to do with how it has interacted with the gravity of Neptune over time.</p>
            <p>Most of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt itself or in the scattered disk:</p>
            <h3>Classical KBOs</h3>
            <p>A large fraction of KBOs orbit the Sun in what's called the classical Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>The term "classical" refers to the fact that, among the KBOs, these objects have orbits most similar to the original, or classical, idea of what the Kuiper Belt was expected to be like, before astronomers started actually finding objects there.</p>
            <p>There are two main groups of objects in the classical Kuiper Belt, referred to as "cold" and "hot."</p>
            <p>These terms don't refer to temperature - instead, they describe the orbits of the objects, along with the amount of influence Neptune's gravity has had on them.</p>
            <p>All classical KBOs have a similar average distance from the Sun between about 40 and 50 AU.</p>
            <p>Cold classical KBOs have relatively circular orbits that are not tilted much away from the plane of the planets; hot classical KBOs have more elliptical and tilted orbits (which astronomers refer to as eccentric and inclined, respectively).</p>
            <p>This means the cold variety spend most of their time at about the same distance from the Sun, while the hot ones wander over a larger range of distances from the Sun (meaning, in some parts of their orbits, they are closer to the Sun and sometimes they are farther away).</p>
            <p>The differences between these two types of bodies in the classical Kuiper Belt have everything to do with Neptune. </p>
            <p>The cold classical KBOs have orbits that never come very close to Neptune, and thus they remain "cool" and unperturbed by the giant planet's gravity.</p>
            <p>Their orbits likely haven't moved much for billions of years. In contrast, the hot classical KBOs have had interactions with Neptune in the past (that is, with the giant planet's gravity).</p>
            <p>These interactions pumped energy into their orbits, which stretched them into an elliptical shape, and tilted them slightly out of the plane of the planets.</p>
            <h3>Resonant KBOs</h3>
            <p>A significant number of KBOs are in orbits that are tightly controlled by Neptune.</p>
            <p>They orbit in resonance with the giant planet, meaning their orbits are in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's.</p>
            <p>These resonant KBOs complete a specific number of orbits in the same amount of time that Neptune completes a specific number of orbits (in other words, a ratio).</p>
            <p>There are several of these groupings, or resonances - 1:1 (pronounced "one to one"), 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.</p>
            <p>For example, Pluto is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning it circles the Sun twice for every three times Neptune goes around.</p>
            <p>In fact, there are enough objects on orbits with this 3:2 resonance, along with Pluto, that astronomers have given them their own category among the resonant KBOs: the plutinos.</p>
            <h3>Scattered Disk</h3>
            <p>The scattered disk is a region that stretches far beyond the main part of the Kuiper Belt, and is home to objects that have been scattered by Neptune into orbits that are highly elliptical and highly inclined to the plane of the planets.</p>
            <p>Many scattered disk objects have orbits that are tilted by tens of degrees.</p>
            <p>Some venture hundreds of AU from the Sun and high above the plane of the planets at the farthest point in their orbits, before falling back to a closest point near the orbit of Neptune.</p>
            <p>The orbits of many objects in the scattered disk are still slowly evolving, with objects here being lost over time, compared to the classical Kuiper Belt, where orbits are more stable.</p>
            <p>The scattered disk gives the donut-shaped classical Kuiper Belt a much wider and thicker extent.</p>
            <p>Some astronomers talk about the two as separate regions, although their boundaries overlap and they are linked together in a number of ways.</p>
            <p>Eris is an example of an object in the scattered disk</p>
            <h2>Additional Families</h2>
            <p>Most of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt or in the scattered disk, but there are also a couple of additional families of objects that orbit the Sun interior and exterior to the belt.</p>
            <p>These additional groups of objects probably came from the Kuiper Belt originally, but have been pulled out of the main regions by the gravity of Neptune or perhaps by another massive planet.</p>
            <h3>Detached objects</h3>
            <p>Detached Kuiper Belt objects have orbits that never come closer to the Sun than about 40 AU.</p>
            <p>This sets them apart from most other KBOs, which spend at least part of their orbits in the region between 40 and 50 AU from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Because their orbits don't come close to Neptune's distance from the Sun (~30 AU), detached objects seem unlikely to have been pulled out of the Kuiper Belt by interactions with the giant planet.</p>
            <p>Scientists think it's likely some other force is responsible, such as an undiscovered giant planet (in a very distant orbit), the gravity of passing stars, or gravitational perturbations as the Kuiper Belt was forming long ago.</p>
            <p>Sedna is an example of a detached KBO. The closest it comes to the Sun is 76 AU, while at its farthest it travels out to ~1200 AU.</p>
            <h3>Centaurs</h3>
            <p>Centaurs are objects with orbits that travel through the space between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune.</p>
            <p>On these orbits, they interact strongly with the gravity of the giant planets.</p>
            <p>Because of these powerful gravitational encounters, most are fated to either be ejected from the solar system or pushed into the inner solar system where they become comets or crash into the Sun and planets.</p>
            <p>This process - the removal of the Centaurs—is ongoing, taking tens of millions of years for the typical Centaur object.</p>
            <p>Thus, the fact that there are Centaurs around today is evidence that they're being actively supplied from somewhere else.</p>
            <p>Astronomers think the most likely explanation is that they're relatively recent escapees from the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>In fact, Centaurs are understood to be scattered objects, like those in the scattered disk—the difference being that the Centaurs have been scattered closer to the Sun by Neptune, rather than farther out.</p>
            <h2>Pluto's Place in the Kuiper Belt</h2>
            <p>Pluto was the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered, in 1930, at a time before astronomers had reason to expect a large population of icy worlds beyond Neptune.</p>
            <p>Today it's known as the "King of the Kuiper Belt" - it's the largest object in the region, even though another object similar in size, called Eris, has a slightly higher mass.</p>
            <p>Pluto’s orbit is said to be in resonance with the orbit of Neptune, meaning Pluto's orbit is in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's.</p>
            <p>For every three orbits completed by Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits.</p>
            <p>In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity.</p>
            <p>In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune's orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune.</p>
            <h2>Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries</h2>
            <p>A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons - that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them - or are binary objects.</p>
            <p>Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point (a shared center of mass) that lies between them.</p>
            <p>Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what's known as a contact binary.</p>
            <p>Pluto, Eris, Haumea and Quaoar are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons.</p>
            <p>Telescope observations suggest the target of the NASA New Horizons spacecraft's 2019 flyby, known as 2014 MU69, may be a contact binary.</p>
            <p>One thing that makes binary KBOs particularly interesting is that most of them may be extremely ancient, or primordial, objects that have been altered little since their formation.</p>
            <p>The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present day Kuiper Belt appears to contain.</p>
            <p>One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity.</p>
            <p>Such collisions were likely much more common billions of years ago, when most KBOs were on similar orbits that were more circular and close to the plane of the planets (called the ecliptic).</p>
            <p>Today such collisions are much rarer.</p>
            <p>They also tend to be destructive, since lots of KBOs are on now orbits that are tilted or elliptical, meaning they crash into each other with greater force and break apart.</p>
            <h2>Relationship to Comets</h2>
            <p>The Kuiper Belt is a source of comets, but not the only source. </p>
            <p>Today the Kuiper Belt is thought to be very slowly eroding itself away.</p>
            <p>Objects there occasionally collide, with the collisional fragments producing smaller KBOs (some of which may become comets), as well as dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind.</p>
            <p>Pieces produced by colliding KBOs can be pushed by Neptune's gravity into orbits that send them sunward, where Jupiter further corrals them into short loops lasting 20 years or less.</p>
            <p>These are called short-period Jupiter-family comets. Given their frequent trips into the inner solar system, most tend to exhaust their volatile ices fairly quickly and eventually become dormant, or dead, comets with little or no detectable activity.</p>
            <p>Researchers have found that some near-Earth asteroids are actually burned-out comets, and most of them would have started out in the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>Many comets crash into the Sun or the planets.</p>
            <p>Those that have close encounters with Jupiter tend to be ripped apart or tossed out of the solar system entirely.</p>
            <p>The other source of comets is the Oort Cloud, where most long-period comets on highly tilted orbits come from.</p>`,

            <h1>Sun</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Sun is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system.</p>
            <p>Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything in its orbit.</p>
            <p>There are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
            <p>The Sun has many names in many cultures. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>The Sun has a radius of 432,168.6 miles (695,508 kilometers). Many stars are several times bigger.</p>
            <p>332,946 Earths match the mass of the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it.</p>
            <p>The Sun is 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>The Sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our Sun is in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.</p>
            <p>Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way.</p>
            <p>The Sun rotates as it orbits the center of the Milky Way. Its spin has an axial tilt of 7.25 degrees with respect to the plane of the planets’ orbits.</p>
            <p>Different parts of the Sun rotate at different rates.</p>
            <p>The Sun spins around once about every 25 days, but at its poles the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>The Sun and the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust called a solar nebula.</p>
            <p>The nebula collapsed because of its overwhelming gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk.</p>
            <p>Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the entire solar system.</p>
            <p>The Sun will someday run out of energy. When the Sun starts to die, it will swell so big that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth.</p>
            <p>Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 6.5 billion years before it shrinks down to be a white dwarf.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>The Sun, like others stars, is a ball of gas. In terms of the number of atoms, it is made of 91.0% hydrogen and 8.9% helium. By mass, the Sun is about 70.6% hydrogen and 27.4% helium.</p>
            <p>The Sun's enormous mass is held together by gravitational attraction, producing immense pressure and temperature at its core.</p>
            <p>The Sun has six regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the visible surface, called the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the outermost region, the corona.</p>
            <p>At the core, the temperature is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>The energy produced in the core powers the Sun and produces all the heat and light the Sun emits.</p>
            <p>Energy from the core is carried outward by radiation, which bounces around the radiative zone, taking about 170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convective zone.</p>
            <p>The temperature drops below 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius) in the convective zone, where large bubbles of hot plasma move upwards.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>The surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is a 300-mile-thick (500-kilometer-thick) region, from which most of the Sun's radiation escapes outward.</p>
            <p>This is not a solid surface like the surfaces of planets. Instead, this is the outer layer of the gassy star.</p>
            <p>The surface of the Sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>We see radiation from the photosphere as sunlight when it reaches Earth about eight minutes after it leaves the Sun.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Above the photosphere lie the tenuous chromosphere and the corona (crown), which make up the thin solar atmosphere. This is where we see features such as sunspots and solar flares.</p>
            <p>Strangely, the temperature in the Sun's atmosphere increases with altitude, reaching as high as 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius). The source of coronal heating has been a scientific mystery for more than 50 years.</p>
            <p>Visible light from these top regions is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter photosphere, but during total solar eclipses, when the moon covers the photosphere, the chromosphere looks like a red rim around the Sun, while the corona forms a beautiful white crown with plasma streamers narrowing outward, forming shapes that look like flower petals.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>The Sun is not a good place for living things, with its hot, energetic mix of gases and plasma.</p>
            <p>It has made life on Earth possible, providing warmth as well as energy that organisms like plants use to form the basis of many food chains.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>The Sun and other stars don't have moons; instead, they have planets and their moons, along with asteroids, comets, and other objects.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>The Sun doesn’t have rings.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>The electric currents in the Sun generate a complex magnetic field that extends out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field. The volume of space controlled by the Sun's magnetic field is called the heliosphere.</p>
            <p>The Sun's magnetic field is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind. Since the Sun rotates, the magnetic field spins out into a large rotating spiral, known as the Parker spiral.</p>
            <p>Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s geographic poles change their magnetic polarity. When this happens, the Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona undergo changes from quiet and calm to violently active.</p>
            <p>The height of the Sun’s activity, known as solar maximum, is a time of solar storms: sunspots, solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These are caused by irregularities in the Sun's magnetic field and can release huge amounts of energy and particles. This space weather can damage satellites, corrode pipelines and affect power grids.</p>`,

            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
            <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.</p>
            <p>Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.</p>
            <p>Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>
            <h2>Temperature</h2>
            <p>Mercury’s surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C).</p>
            <p>Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).</p>
            <p>Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions of permanent shadow. </p>
            <p>There it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance:</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.</p>
            <p>Mercury is 0.4 AU away from the Sun. It takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation:</h2>
            <p>Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.</p>
            <p>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days.</p>
            <p>But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets.</p>
            <p>The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface.</p>
            <p>The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface.</p>
            <p>One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days—just over two years on Mercury.</p>
            <p>Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons like many other planets do.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth.</p>
            <p>It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet's radius.</p>
            <p>There is evidence that it is partly molten, or liquid.</p>
            <p>Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Mercury formed about 4.6 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun.</p>
            <p>Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets.</p>
            <p>Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history.</p>
            <p>While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high.</p>
            <p>They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.</p>
            <p>Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye.</p>
            <p>The bright streaks are called "crater rays." They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface.</p>
            <p>The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact.</p>
            <p>Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays.</p>
            <p>Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter.</p>
            <p>The space environment—dust impacts and solar-wind particles—causes the rays to darken with time.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids.</p>
            <p>Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator.</p>
            <p>Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just one percent the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet.</p>
            <p>When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Mercury has no moon.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. </p>
            <p>The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.</p>`,

            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor.</p>
            <p>Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.</p>
            <p>Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.</p>
            <p>Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains.</p>
            <p>Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the Ancient Greeks.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 3,760 miles (6,052 kilometers), Venus is roughly the same size as Earth</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), Venus is 0.7 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 6 minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Venus' rotation and orbit are unusual in several ways.</p>
            <p>Venus is one of just two planets that rotate from east to west. Only Venus and Uranus have this "backwards" rotation.</p>
            <p>It completes one rotation in 243 Earth days — the longest day of any planet in our solar system, even longer than a whole year on Venus.</p>
            <p>But the Sun doesn't rise and set each "day" on Venus like it does on most other planets.</p>
            <p>On Venus, one day-night cycle takes 117 Earth days because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around the Sun.</p>
            <p>Venus makes a complete orbit around the Sun in 225 Earth days or slightly less than two Venusian day-night cycles.</p>
            <p>Its orbit around the Sun is the most circular of any planet, nearly a perfect circle. Other planet's orbits are more elliptical, or oval-shaped.</p>
            <p>With an axial tilt of just 3 degrees, Venus spins nearly upright, and so does not experience noticeable seasons.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Venus is in many ways similar to Earth in its structure.</p>
            <p>It has an iron core that is approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) in radius</p>
            <p>Above that is a mantle made of hot rock slowly churning due to the planet's interior heat.</p>
            <p>The surface is a thin crust of rock that bulges and moves as Venus' mantle shifts and creates volcanoes.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.6 billion years ago, Venus formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form the second planet from the Sun</p>
            <p>Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Venus has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>From space, Venus is bright white because it is covered with clouds that reflect and scatter sunlight.</p>
            <p>At the surface, the rocks are different shades of grey, like rocks on Earth, but the thick atmosphere filters the sunlight so that everything would look orange if you were standing on Venus.</p>
            <p>Venus has mountains, valleys, and tens of thousands of volcanoes.</p>
            <p>The highest mountain on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is 20,000 feet high (8.8 kilometers), similar to the highest mountain on Earth, Mount Everest.</p>
            <p>The landscape is dusty, and surface temperatures reach a scalding 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>It is thought that Venus was completely resurfaced by volcanic activity 300 to 500 million years ago.</p>
            <p>Venus has two large highland areas: Ishtar Terra, about the size of Australia, in the north polar region; and Aphrodite Terra, about the size of South America, straddling the equator and extending for almost 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers).</p>
            <p>Venus is covered in craters, but none are smaller than 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) across.</p>
            <p>Small meteoroids burn up in the dense atmosphere, so only large meteoroids reach the surface and create impact craters.</p>
            <p>Almost all the surface features of Venus are named for noteworthy Earth women, both mythological and real.</p>
            <p>A volcanic crater is named for Sacajawea, the Native American woman who guided Lewis and Clark's exploration.</p>
            <p>A deep canyon is named for Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Venus' atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets.</p>
            <p>The thick atmosphere traps the Sun's heat, resulting in surface temperatures higher than 880 degrees Fahrenheit (470 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>The atmosphere has many layers with different temperatures.</p>
            <p>At the level where the clouds are, about 30 miles up from the surface, it's about the same temperature as on the surface of the Earth</p>
            <p>As Venus moves forward in its solar orbit while slowly rotating backwards on its axis, the top level of clouds zips around the planet every four Earth days, driven by hurricane-force winds traveling at about 224 miles (360 kilometers) per hour.</p>
            <p>Atmospheric lightning bursts light up these quick-moving clouds. </p>
            <p>Speeds within the clouds decrease with cloud height, and at the surface are estimated to be just a few miles per hour.</p>
            <p>On the ground, it would look like a very hazy, overcast day on Earth.</p>
            <p>And the atmosphere is so heavy it would feel like you were 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) deep underwater.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Even though Venus is similar in size to the Earth and has a similarly-sized iron core, Venus' magnetic field is much weaker than the Earth's due to Venus' slow rotation.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Venus has no rings.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Venus has no moons.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>No human has visited Venus, but the spacecraft that have been sent to the surface of Venus do not last very long there.</p>
            <p>Venus' high surface temperatures overheat electronics in spacecraft in a short time, so it seems unlikely that a person could survive for long on the Venusian surface.</p>
            <p>There is speculation about life existing in Venus' distant past, as well as questions about the possibility of life in the top cloud layers of Venus' atmosphere, where the temperatures are less extreme.</p>`,

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
            <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>
            <p>Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>
            <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old.</p>
            <p>All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.</p>
            <p>However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly 1 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours.</p>
            <p>It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun.</p>
            <p>That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days.</p>
            <p>To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. </p>
            <p>That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.</p>
            <p>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons.</p>
            <p>During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away.</p>
            <p>With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there.</p>
            <p>Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south.</p>
            <p>Six months later, the situation is reversed.</p>
            <p>When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle and crust.</p>
            <p>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius.</p>
            <p>There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>Surrounding the inner core is the outer core.</p>
            <p>This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.</p>
            <p>In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer.</p>
            <p>This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel.</p>
            <p>The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land.</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.6 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains and valleys.</p>
            <p>Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving.</p>
            <p>For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails.</p>
            <p>Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.</p>
            <p>Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70 percent of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97 percent of Earth's water.</p>
            <p>Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans.</p>
            <p>Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater.</p>
            <p>Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.</p>
            <p>It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon.</p>
            <p>The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space.</p>
            <p>When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles.</p>
            <p>These air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern lights</p>
            <p>The magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn.</p>
            <p>But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
            <p>The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is very irregular.</p>
            <p>As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn't cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years.</p>
            <p>But when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed, they will all point south instead of north.​</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Earth has no rings.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky.</p>
            <p>In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home.</p>
            <p>It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.</p>
            <p>Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks.</p>
            <p>They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p> Some asteroids will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.</p>
            <p>Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions of years ago.</p>
            <p>When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior.</p>
            <p>The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto and Io).</p>
            <p>The Moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize.</p>
            <p>The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life possible here.</p>
            <p>Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time.</p>
            <p>Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</p>
            <p>Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.</p>`,

    mars: {
        content: `
            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood.</p>
            <p>Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute; for example, the Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."</p>
            <p>Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours).</p>
            <p>Martian days are called sols - short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.</p>
            <p>Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun</p>
            <p>And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.</p>
            <p>Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days.</p>
            <p>Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius.</p>
            <p>It's made of iron, nickel and sulfur.</p>
            <p>Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and potassium.</p>
            <p>This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.6 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>The Red Planet is actually many colors.</p>
            <p>At the surface we see colors such as brown, gold and tan.</p>
            <p>The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidation or rusting of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars.</p>
            <p>This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land.</p>
            <p>Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.</p>
            <p>A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York - more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers).</p>
            <p>This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon.</p>
            <p>Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.</p>
            <p>It's three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico</p>
            <p>Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water.</p>
            <p>Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
            <p>There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface.</p>
            <p>Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon gases.</p>
            <p>To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth.</p>
            <p>Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids and comets.</p>
            <p>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet.</p>
            <p>If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.​</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids.</p>
            <p>They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.</p>
            <p>Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface.</p>
            <p>It is slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.</p>
            <p>Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars.</p>
            <p>Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars.</p>
            <p>Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.</p>`,

            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system - more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p>Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>
            <p>Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons.</p>
            <p>Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system.</p>
            <p>One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).</p>
            <p>Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees.</p>
            <p>This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun - mostly hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p>Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid.</p>
            <p>This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system - an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water.</p>
            <p>Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field.</p>
            <p>It is still unclear if, deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup.</p>
            <p>It could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down there, made mostly of iron and silicate minerals (similar to quartz).</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Jupiter took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant.</p>
            <p>Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system.</p>
            <p>In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.</p>
            <p>About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from the Sun.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface.</p>
            <p>The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids.</p>
            <p>While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.</p>
            <p>The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and spots.</p>
            <p>The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers).</p>
            <p>The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals.</p>
            <p>The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.</p>
            <p>The vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. </p>
            <p>Jupiter's fast rotation - spinning once every 10 hours, creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.</p>
            <p>With no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years.</p>
            <p>Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator.</p>
            <p>The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years.</p>
            <p>More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin.</p>
            <p>Scientists do not yet know if these ovals and planet-circling bands are shallow or deeply rooted to the interior.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field.</p>
            <p>It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter or Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth.</p>
            <p>It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge.</p>
            <p>Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's magnetic field also causes some of the solar system's most spectacular aurorae at the planet's poles.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Jupiter's rings were a surprise, as they are composed of small, dark particles and are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.</p>
            <p>Jupiter has 53 confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons are named after they are confirmed.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's four largest moons - Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope.</p>
            <p>These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system.</p>
            <p>Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.</p>
            <p>Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury).</p>
            <p>Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity</p>
            <p>A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it.</p>
            <p>The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>

            <p>Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system.</p>
            <p>There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.</p>`,

            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.</p>
            <p>Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.</p>
            <p>It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's.</p>
            <p>Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p>Surrounded by more than 60 known moons, Saturn is home to some of the most fascinating landscapes in our solar system.</p>
            <p>From the jets of water that spray from Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.</p>
            <p>The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times.</p>
            <p>The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system.</p>
            <p>One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days).</p>
            <p>Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt.</p>
            <p>This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p>At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by the intense pressure and heat.</p>
            <p>It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen</p>
            <p>It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system whose average density is less than water.</p>
            <p>The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant.</p>
            <p>About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface.</p>
            <p>The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down.</p>
            <p>While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.</p>
            <p>The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the plane
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams and storms.</p>
            <p>The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown and grey.</p>
            <p>Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region.</p>
            <p> In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second).</p>
            <p>And the pressure - the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater - is so powerful it squeezes gas into liquid.</p>
            <p>Saturn's north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature - a six-sided jet stream.</p>
            <p>This hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the Cassini spacecraft since.</p>
            <p>Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive, rotating storm at the center.</p>
            <p>There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as Earth's.</p>
            <p>Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the solar wind.</p>
            <p>Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines.</p>
            <p>On Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind.</p>
            <p>Cassini showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely unaffected by the solar wind.</p>
            <p>Instead, these aurorae are caused by a combination of particles ejected from Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation rate.</p>
            <p>But these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity.</p>
            <p>They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with another material such as dust.</p>
            <p>The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house.</p>
            <p> A few particles are as large as mountains.</p>
            <p>The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.</p>
            <p>Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings.</p>
            <p>Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) wide called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B.</p>
            <p>The main rings are A, B and C. Rings D, E, F and G are fainter and more recently discovered.</p>
            <p>Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring.</p>
            <p>Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds.</p>
            <p>From the haze-shrouded surface of Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the Saturn system.</p>
            <p>Currently Saturn has 53 confirmed moons with 29 additional provisional moons awaiting confirmation.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.</p>
            <p>The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>
            <p>While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.</p>
            <p>Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.</p>`,

            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy.</p>
            <p>The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.</p>
            <p>This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.</p>
            <p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.</p>
            <p>It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.</p>
            <p>William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III.</p>
            <p>Instead the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 AU away from the Sun</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours and Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).</p>
            <p>Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees - possibly the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago.</p>
            <p>This unique tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter.</p>
            <p>Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite direction than most of the planets (Venus is the other one), from east to west.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune).</p>
            <p>Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia - above a small rocky core.</p>
            <p>Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>Uranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass.</p>
            <p>It is the second least dense planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.</p>
            <p>Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops.</p>
            <p>Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant.</p>
            <p>Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface.</p>
            <p>The planet is mostly swirling fluids.</p>
            <p>While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either.</p>
            <p>The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia.</p>
            <p>The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.</p>
            <p>While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986, more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features.</p>
            <p>Uranus' planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even colder than Neptune in some places.</p>
            <p>Wind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus.</p>
            <p>Winds are retrograde at the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the planet’s rotation.</p>
            <p>But closer to the poles, winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere.</p>
            <p>Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet's radius.</p>
            <p>Auroras on Uranus are not in line with the poles (like they are on Earth, Jupiter and Saturn) due to the lopsided magnetic field.</p>
            <p>The magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into space for millions of miles.</p>
            <p>Its magnetic field lines are twisted by Uranus’ sideways rotation into a long corkscrew shape.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Uranus has two sets of rings.</p>
            <p>The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings.</p>
            <p>There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.</p>
            <p>In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Uranus has 27 known moons.</p>
            <p>While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>
            <p>All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock.</p>
            <p>The composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it.</p>
            <p>The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>`,

            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
            <p>More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye.</p>
            <p>In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
            <p>Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.</p>
            <p>The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.</p>
            <p>The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations.</p>
            <p>Using predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846.</p>
            <p>The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours and Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).</p>
            <p>Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto.</p>
            <p>Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years.</p>
            <p>This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999.</p>
            <p>Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two.</p>
            <p>This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.</p>
            <p>Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth.</p>
            <p>This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus).</p>
            <p>Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia - above a small, rocky core.</p>
            <p>Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>
            <p>Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds.</p>
            <p>It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant.</p>
            <p>Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Neptune does not have a solid surface.</p>
            <p>Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane.</p>
            <p>Neptune's neighbor Uranus is a blue-green color due to such atmospheric methane, but Neptune is a more vivid, brighter blue, so there must be an unknown component that causes the more intense color.</p>
            <p>Neptune is our solar system's windiest world.</p>
            <p>Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's.</p>
            <p>These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour).</p>
            <p>Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).</p>
            <p>In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the "Great Dark Spot" was large enough to contain the entire Earth.</p>
            <p>That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis.</p>
            <p>Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment.</p>
            <p>The magnetic field of Neptune is about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.​</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominient ring arcs that we know of so far.</p>
            <p>Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams.</p>
            <p>The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Neptune has 14 known moons.</p>
            <p>Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet.</p>
            <p>Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.</p>
            <p>Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured.</p>
            <p>Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers).</p>
            <p>Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.</p>
            <p>The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>`,

            <h1>Pluto</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and maybe glaciers.</p>
            <p>Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.</p>
            <p>Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 715 miles (1,151 kilometers), Pluto is about 1/6 the width of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), Pluto is 39 AU away from the sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the sun to Pluto.</p>
            <p>If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here on Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Pluto's orbit around the sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted.</p>
            <p>Pluto's 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 AU from the sun, and as close as 30 AU.</p>
            <p>One day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the sun, so it spins almost on its side.</p>
            <p>Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation, spinning from east to west.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's moon and probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice.</p>
            <p>Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat its surface.</p>
            <p>Due to its lower density, Pluto's mass is about one-sixth of Earth's moon.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Pluto's surface is characterized by mountains, valleys, plains, and craters.</p>
            <p>The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>Pluto's mountains can be as tall as 6,500 to 9,800 feet (2 to 3 kilometers) and are big blocks of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane.</p>
            <p>Long troughs and valleys as long as 370 miles (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet.</p>
            <p>Craters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some showing signs of erosion and filling.</p>
            <p>The most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the sun and collapses as it moves farther away.</p>
            <p>The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.</p>
            <p>When Pluto is close to the sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Pluto's low gravity causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet's atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet's atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>It isn't known whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest little or none.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>There are no known rings around Pluto.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx.</p>
            <p>This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.</p>
            <p>Charon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.</p>
            <p>Charon orbits Pluto at a distance of just 12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our moon is 20 times farther away from Earth. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a double planet.</p>
            <p>Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours—the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking.</p>
            <p>Pluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide.</p>
            <p>They're also irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</p>
            <p>At such cold temperatures, water is essentially rock-like.</p>
            <p>Pluto's interior is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside.</p>`,

            <h1>Ceres</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system.</p>
            <p>Called an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006.</p>
            <p>Even though Ceres comprises 25 percent of the asteroid belt's total mass, tiny Pluto is still 14 times more massive.</p>
            <p>Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 AU away from the sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 22 minutes to travel from the sun to Ceres.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Ceres takes 1,682 Earth days, or 4.6 Earth years, to make one trip around the sun.</p>
            <p>As Ceres orbits the sun, it completes one rotation every 9 hours, making its day length one of the shortest in the solar system.</p>
            <p>Ceres' axis of rotation is tilted just 4 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn't experience seasons like other more tilted planets do.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet.</p>
            <p>Scientists describe Ceres as an "embryonic planet," which means it started to form but didn't quite finish. Nearby Jupiter's strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet.</p>
            <p>About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense.</p>
            <p>One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres' layers aren’t as clearly defined.</p>
            <p>Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does.</p>
            <p>Ceres' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt, but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.6 billion-year lifetime.</p>
            <p>The lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface.</p>
            <p>The surface features could smooth out over time if ice or another lower-density material, such as salt, is just below the surface.</p>
            <p>It's also possible that past hydrothermal activity, such as ice volcanoes, erased some large craters.   </p>
            <p>Within some of Ceres' craters, there are regions that are always in shadow. It's possible that without direct sunlight, these "cold traps" could have water ice in them for long periods of time.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Ceres has a very thin atmosphere, and there is evidence it contains water vapor. The vapor may be produced by ice volcanoes or by ice near the surface sublimating.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life.</p>
            <p>Ceres has something a lot of other planets don't: water.</p>
            <p>Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it's possible that with this ingredient and a few other conditions met, life could maybe exist there.</p>
            <p>Living things on Ceres, if they are there at all, would likely be very small microbes similar to bacteria. And while Ceres might not have living things today, there could be signs it harbored life in the past.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Ceres does not have any moons.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Ceres does not have any rings.</p>

            <h1>Makemake</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Along with fellow dwarf planets Pluto, Eris and Haumea, Makemake is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region outside the orbit of Neptune.</p>
            <p>Slightly smaller than Pluto, Makemake is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt as seen from Earth.</p>
            <p>It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the sun.</p>
            <p>Makemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet and to create the new group of dwarf planets.</p>
            <p>Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of approximately 444 miles (715 kilometers), Makemake is 1/9 the radius of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 4,253,000,000 miles (6,847,000,000 kilometers), Makemake is 45.8 AU away from the sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 6 hours and 20 minutes to travel from the sun to Makemake.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Makemake takes 305 Earth years to make one trip around the sun.</p>
            <p>As Makemake orbits the sun, it completes one rotation every 22 and a half hours, making its day length similar to Earth and Mars.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Scientists know very little about Makemake's structure.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>We can't see too many details of Makemake's surface from so far away, but it does appear to be a reddish-brownish color.</p>
            <p>Scientists have also detected frozen methane and ethane on its surface.</p>
            <p>In fact, pellets of frozen methane as big as half an inch (1 centimeter) in diameter may rest on Makemake's cold surface.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Makemake may develop a very thin atmosphere, most likely made of nitrogen, near perihelion - when it is closest to the sun.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>The surface of Makemake is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Makemake has one provisional moon, S/2015 (136472) 1 and nicknamed MK 2.</p>
            <p>It is more than 1,300 times fainter than Makemake.</p>
            <p>MK 2 was seen approximately 13,000 miles from the dwarf planet, and its radius is estimated to be about 50 miles (80 kilometers).</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Haumea resides in the Kuiper belt and is roughly the same size as Pluto. Its fast spin distorts Haumea's shape, making this dwarf planet look like a football.</p>
            <p>Haumea was named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of about 385 miles (620 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/14 the radius of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 4,010,000,000 miles (6,452,000,000 kilometers), Haumea is 43 AU away from the Sun.</p>

            <h1>Eris</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Eris is one of the largest known dwarf planets in our solar system.</p>
            <p>It's about the same size as Pluto, but is three times farther from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Eris first appeared to be larger than Pluto. This triggered a debate in the scientific community that led to the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to clarify the definition of a planet. Pluto, Eris and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets.</p>
            <p>Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of about 722 miles (1,163 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the radius of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 6,289,000,000 miles (10,125,000,000 kilometers), Eris is about 68 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight more than nine hours to travel from the Sun to the surface of Eris.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun.</p>
            <p>The plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system's planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
            <p>As Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>We know very little about Eris' internal structure.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto.</p>
            <p>Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow.</p>
            <p>As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia.</p>
            <p>Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days.</p>
            <p>This moon is named after Eris' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.</p>
            <p>Dysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other.</p>
