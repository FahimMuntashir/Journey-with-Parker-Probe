# SOLAR SCHOLAR

## High Level Project Summary:
**We attempted to create an interactive web application for younger people, with the goal of inspiring them to gain a deeper understanding of the Sun & the Parker Solar Probe. This contains material in the audience's local language, and a variety of activities that will be both appealing to and beneficial to the youngsters. They will gradually get familiar with the Solar System and the voyage that Parker Solar Probe had to get closer to the Sun, and they will learn more about both of these topics. Increasing the level of commitment and interest shown by the younger audience may result in more significant ideas & breakthroughs that will beautify the forthcoming research days on this planet.**

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States (NASA) tasked us with devising an original method of communicating to younger audiences the awe-inspiring story of Parker's record-breaking journey from Earth to the Sun and all of the obstacles it overcame along the way. We came up with the idea of using a video game as a medium to tell the tale. You are more than welcome to try out our newly created web application called solar scholar, which gives you the opportunity to experience what it could be like to utilize a Parker solar probe to simulate a voyage to the sun. If you are interested, you can find the application here. The Parker Solar Probe is now on a mission with the objective of "touching the surface of the Sun," and the spacecraft is currently going closer to the surface of the Sun than any other spacecraft has ever traveled in the history of space travel. As a direct result of this mission, our current conceptions about the Sun are going to be subjected to major modification.

In order to train younger audiences in an efficient manner, this website provides a thorough knowledge of the subject matter at hand and sparks their inherent drive to learn by making the lesson fascinating and fun to participate in. This website may come in handy if you're interested in the cosmos and want to get a better understanding of how different types of data can be represented visually. The enjoyable experience that is delivered by this dynamic and animated website encourages viewers to become more interested in the content that is being presented. This website will also deepen people's visual knowledge to a much greater extent than traditional diagrams can because it eliminates unnecessary language and pictures, makes it possible for individuals to communicate their thoughts quickly, and makes it possible for individuals to communicate with one another in a hurry.

## OUR SOLUTION
We developed a web application which allows you to experience what it would be like to travel to the sun by utilizing a Parker solar probe. This is free to make use of the application at any time. In order to effectively instruct younger audiences, we have developed a solid understanding of the topic at hand and pique their innate desire to learn by making the lesson interesting and fun to participate in. This website will be a fun favorite for those who are interested in the cosmos and want to find out more about the different ways in which data can be represented graphically. People are more likely to be interested in the content of the website because of the blissful experience that it provides, which is dynamic and animated. This website will also deepen people's visual understanding to a much greater extent than traditional diagrams can because it eliminates unnecessary verbiage and visuals, makes it possible for people to communicate their ideas quickly, and makes it possible for people to communicate their ideas quickly.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
![SystemArchitecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59383895/193375723-015167a3-e8e6-4e6c-9d76-61516ad4fd61.jpg)

The webpage opens with a simulation of the Parker Probe orbiting the sun. Other space components and NASA equipment will travel around the simulation based on acquired data. This animation will portray simultaneous real-world events. If a user wants to learn more about a component exhibited during that period, he must click on it. The structure zooms in on that component and provides further information. If a user wants to learn more about a feature during that period, he must click on it. Average people will be more intrigued than ever about this. We used NASA's API and other resources. This lets us use NASA's data. The need for online education is rising worldwide, so we're making our curriculum accessible for business settings. We'll need to cooperate with BASIS & SPARSO, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, NASA, and other space agencies.

At last, we can say our Parker Solar Probe website could change human lives. We've made progress. Finally!
